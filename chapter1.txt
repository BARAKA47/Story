Day 1 of Engineering the little things and today's topic is about tissues well let's imagine together where the need to invent tissues came from,
clearly all of us use tissues it's very helpful to have tissues everywhere, I mean if you want to cry, wipe spilled food, make a boundary between
yourself and anything you don't want to touch directly, when you got flu it's more than your friend I wonder where all this fluids were going to 
go without those beautiful creatures and yeah I almost forgot what the west were going to do without them in the toilet so clearly, who ever started
making them had a visionary mind or not maybe he just wanted to enjoy himself, but let's dig into the meaning of tissues more what are they,
I mean we can imagine them as little peace of clothes but they are very cheap and pale that they can be used just one time, or we can look 
at them like a piece of paper but wasn't strong enough actually it happened to me more than one time that I will start riding things at ttissues
just cause they are so easy to reach anywhere, we can't deny that tissues are like the jack of all trades also they've multiple fields where 
they are masters without any efforts don't look at me toilets, now we see why there's tissues and why they're still being produced 
let's get into why they are produced this way like why are they white colored I think yellow would be very interesting color to have 
everywhere also really attractive, maybe red but we need to see the color of some of our fluids so red won't be that helpful, Blue why not
really calming and maybe add some light touch to it so it becomes cyan why did we just gave away all those wonderful choices and just 
settle for white, why are we making them with this rectangular shape I mean there's so much cool shapes and we just go for the most basic
booring shape we could've had tissues in circular, triangular, trapezoidal shapes I mean why rectangular!!!, Ah! What a loss, and oh let's not forget
the people who are putting those really bad patterns on them are they have problems with smooth surfaces like there's not enough harsh objects in the 
nature so we decided that the thing we really need to be soft has to have some useless pattern on it shame on you industrial revoulution,
another question I always had why are they making them in doubled layers what's wrong with making them alittle bit thicker I mean that's a reallys
stupid thing to do, you know I can tolerate all of thi but there's something I just can't let go in this world full of ads everywhere someone is 
paying huge amounts of money to put their name or brand in some place visible to other people and they're leaving behind the most visible place on 
the planet I mean what is it going to cost you to put some color on piece of soft paper you're wasting huge opportunities right here, I mean go
invent some colors that don't bother me when I'm sick put some advices, Be RESPECTFUL and treat them as you treat Paper, GOOd nighT everyone.
